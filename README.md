## ‚ö†Ô∏è Enabling PowerShell Script Execution

By default, Windows restricts the execution of PowerShell scripts. You need to enable script execution temporarily:

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**  
   - Press `Windows` key, type `powershell`
   - Right-click on **Windows PowerShell** and select **Run as administrator**

2. **Set Execution Policy Temporarily**  
   In the PowerShell window, run:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
   ```

   This command allows scripts to run only in your current session, keeping your system secure.
